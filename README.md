## Encoding, Decoding & Hacking Vigenere cipher

![Stage 1](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img1.png "Stage 1")

This project was created for the educational purposes of the course "Methods of information security" ([Vladimir State University](http://vlsu.ru), specialty ID is 230101).

It is a web-application for the encoding, decoding & hacking Vigenere cipher. Result of hacking is analysing by using Markov chains.

### Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Django 1.5
* MySQL Server 5.5.6
* Apache2
* IDE PyCharm

### Example Usage

Source code for those steps right here: ["../master/logic/"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/tree/master/logic).

* Step 1: ["Encoding"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img1.png)
* Step 2: ["Statistical analysing and hacking"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img2.png)
* Step 3: ["Creating Markov chain"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img3.png)
* Step 4: ["Providing information for Markov chain"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img4.png)
* Step 5: ["Result of analysing"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img5.png) by using trained chain with ["detected key"](https://github.com/siggb/HackingVigenereCipher/blob/master/static/images/img6.png)
